# 🦖 Maze Away

## 🚀 Introduction
You thought dinosaurs went extinct because of an asteroid? Think again!

Millions of years ago, an evil wizard from the future trapped all the dinosaurs inside a deep, deep, deeeeep cave-like maze. Many perished, but Dino survived. Ever since, he's been climbing his way up, searching for the surface.

But there's a problem—the maze is ever-changing, too complex for even the sharpest Dino mind to comprehend.

Can you help Dino escape and save his species?
